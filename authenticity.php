      we offer for sale on the site, is a genuine work of the artist listed.

      However, in the unlikely event that any item, which you purchase
      from arnoldkleingallery.com, is subsequently proven to be unauthentic, 
      arnoldkleingallery.com will refund the full purchase price and shipping 
      costs paid by you. These cases will be handled on a case-by-case basis 
      and requires that an established authority provide examinable proof of

          2. The item is returned in the same condition that it was in,
