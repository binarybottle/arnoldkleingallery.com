Just what everyone has been waiting for--a new exhibit at the Gallery! 
<br /><br />
Very fine prints and paintings based on the theme of water!  
<br /><br />
If you have no interest in water, this will of course be of little interest. However, the following 19th and 20th century artists were intrigued enough to have contributed works:  Lep&egrave;re, McBey, Lebadang, Vollmer, Hundertwasser, Dufy, Oglesbee (photograph), Haden, Calapai, Warhol, et al.

<br /><br />
ALL OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2008, 11 TO 5 TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.  
<br />
(Towards the end of December please telephone or fax 248 647 7709 to discover which days we will not be there.)
